## üõ†Ô∏è 15-Minute Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contracts (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to contracts
cd bastion-protocol/contracts

# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_sepolia_private_key"
export SEPOLIA_RPC="https://rpc.sepolia.org"

# Build and deploy
forge build
forge script script/DeployBastion.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify

# Save the deployed addresses!
```

### Step 2: Configure Frontend (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd bastion-protocol/frontend/bastion-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Update contract addresses in src/services/contract-service.ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  BASTION_CORE: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CORE_ADDRESS',
  BASTION_LENDING: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_LENDING_ADDRESS',
  BASTION_CIRCLES: '0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CIRCLES_ADDRESS',
};

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Complete Flow (5 minutes)

1. **Connect Wallet**: MetaMask to Sepolia testnet
2. **Get Test Tokens**: Automatic Yellow Test USD via integrated faucet  
3. **Create Loan**: Request 100 Test USD with 150 collateral, 5% interest
4. **Test ROSCA**: Create circle with 50 monthly contribution, invite members
5. **Verify Operations**: Check instant transfers via Nitrolite state channels
