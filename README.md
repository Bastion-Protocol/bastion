## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for smart contracts (optional for frontend-only)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose (optional for local development)
- Sepolia testnet ETH ([Get from faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com))

> 💡 **Quick Start Tip**: You can start with just the frontend if you want to test with existing deployed contracts!

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bastion-Protocol/bastion.git
cd bastion

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contracts (Optional - Already deployed on testnet)
```bash
cd bastion-protocol/contracts

# Install Foundry (if not installed)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
export SEPOLIA_RPC="https://rpc.sepolia.org"
forge script script/DeployBastion.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

### 3. Start Frontend Application
```bash
cd bastion-protocol/frontend/bastion-app
npm install

# If you encounter build errors, see TROUBLESHOOTING.md
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

> ⚠️ **Build Issues?** If you encounter crypto/buffer errors, see our [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#frontend-build-issues)

### 4. Get Test Tokens & Start Lending
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and select MetaMask
2. **Get Yellow Test USD**: App automatically requests test tokens from faucet
3. **Create or Fulfill Loans**: Start with small amounts to test functionality
4. **Join ROSCA Circles**: Create or participate in community lending circles

### Component Overview

#### 🏛️ Bastion Protocol
The core lending platform with three main contracts:
- **BastionCore**: User profiles and multi-dimensional trust scoring
- **BastionLending**: P2P loan creation, fulfillment, and repayment
- **BastionCircles**: ROSCA circle management with bidding mechanics

#### ⚡ Nitrolite Framework  
State channel infrastructure enabling instant, gasless operations:
- **Contract Layer**: On-chain custody and dispute resolution
- **Clearnode**: Off-chain message broker and state management
- **SDK**: TypeScript client for state channel operations
- **Yellow Network Integration**: Production-ready infrastructure

---

## 💡 How It Works

### P2P Lending Flow
```
Borrower creates loan request → Lender reviews & fulfills → 
Instant fund transfer via state channel → Borrower repays → 
Trust scores updated → Collateral released
```

### ROSCA Circle Flow
```
Members join circle → Monthly contributions → Submit bids → 
Lowest bidder wins early access → Funds distributed instantly → 
Cycle repeats until all members benefit
```

### Trust Scoring Algorithm
- **40%** Payment History (on-time repayments, defaults)
- **30%** Circle Participation (completions, reliability)
- **20%** DeFi Experience (transaction volume, protocol usage)
- **10%** Social Verification (KYC, community attestations)

## 🛠️ Development Guide

### Smart Contract Development

```bash
cd bastion-protocol/contracts

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test

# Deploy locally
anvil # In separate terminal
forge script script/DeployBastion.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --broadcast
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd bastion-protocol/frontend/bastion-app

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Nitrolite SDK Development

```bash
cd nitrolite/sdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build SDK
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Generate documentation
npm run docs:generate
```

---

## 🌐 Deployment

### Testnet Deployment (Sepolia)
```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_sepolia_private_key"
export SEPOLIA_RPC="https://rpc.sepolia.org"
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your_etherscan_key"

# Deploy contracts
cd bastion-protocol/contracts
forge script script/DeployBastion.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast \
  --verify

# Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
cd bastion-protocol/frontend/bastion-app
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to hosting service
```

### Production Deployment Considerations
- **Security Audit**: Complete audit of all smart contracts required
- **Multi-signature**: Use multi-sig wallets for admin functions
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for contract events and state channel status
- **Scaling**: Configure multiple Clearnode instances for high availability
- **Legal**: Ensure compliance with local lending regulations

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Smart contract tests
cd bastion-protocol/contracts && forge test

# SDK tests  
cd nitrolite/sdk && npm test

# Integration tests
cd nitrolite/integration && npm test

# Frontend tests
cd bastion-protocol/frontend/bastion-app && npm test
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Loan Lifecycle**: Create → Fund → Repay → Settle
2. **ROSCA Cycles**: Join → Contribute → Bid → Receive
3. **Trust Scoring**: Payment history impact on rates
4. **State Channels**: Off-chain transfers and settlements
5. **Error Handling**: Network failures, insufficient funds

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is Bastion Protocol safe to use?**
A: Currently in testnet phase. Production deployment requires security audit completion.

**Q: How do state channels work?**
A: Participants sign transactions off-chain for instant execution. Settlement happens on-chain when needed.

**Q: What are the fees?**
A: Platform takes 1-2% on loan origination and 0.5% on ROSCA operations. State channel operations are gas-free.

**Q: Can I use this on mainnet?**
A: Not yet. Mainnet deployment planned after security audit completion.

**Q: How is trust score calculated?**
A: Multi-factor algorithm based on payment history, community participation, and verification status.

**Q: I'm having build/setup issues, where can I get help?**
A: Check our [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) first, then join our Discord community.
